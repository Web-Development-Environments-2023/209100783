## introduction
Welcome to this website dedicated to my grandmother, who immigrated from the USSR to Beer Sheva, Israel. She is an accomplished physicist, holding a second degree in the field. As one of her three grandsons, I wanted to create this website to honor her and the impact she has had on my life. Growing up, my grandmother played a vital role in raising me, and I have many fond memories of spending time with her. I hope that this website can serve as a tribute to her life and legacy.
